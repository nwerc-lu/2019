# About

[NWERC 2019](nwerc.eu) - North Western Europe Regional Contest is a yearly programming competition, with participants from the Nordics, Germany, UK, the Netherlands and Belgium. About 120 teams participate each year. The top 3-5 of NWERC advance to the international finals ICPC.

The faculty of Engineering at Lund University (LTH) sends 1-3 teams to NWERC each year. 2019 it will take place in Eindhoven, the 23-25th of November.

My name is Måns Magnusson (coach for the teams from Lund University). 2017 I participated at NWERC and our team ended up in 17th place.

In 2018 `from __future__ import soluton` also placed 17th at NWERC, and Lund's second team `¡i¡i¡` placed 38th. For 2019 we hope for even better results and that we will be able to send 3 teams.
