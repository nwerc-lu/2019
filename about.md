# About

[NWERC 2019](nwerc.eu) - North Western Europe Regional Contest is a yearly programming competition, with participants from the Nordics, Germany, UK, the Netherlands and Belgium. About 120 teams participate each year. The top 3-5 NWERC teams advance to the international finals ICPC, which this time takes place in Moscow, Russia - the Mecca of Competitive Programming!

The faculty of Engineering at Lund University (LTH) sends 1-3 teams to NWERC each year. 2019 it will take place in Eindhoven, the 15-17th of November.

Along on the journey are also some coaches, who makes sure the teams are prepared and happy, and that the participants go to bed in time, and don't drink too much beer. We also write this blog, which we will report from live during the competition. This year we are Måns Magnusson and Maj Stenmark!

In 2018 `from __future__ import soluton` also placed 17th at NWERC, and Lund's second team `¡i¡i¡` placed 38th. This year both teams are joined by a third team `Balloon Overflow`. We now hope for even better results!
