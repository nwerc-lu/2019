Problem E now has 8 solves, and about 100 failed submissions.

You can [find the problem here](https://open.kattis.com/contests/nwerc19open/problems/expeditiouscubing).

There is one easy error to not follow the instructions: "Output the number to exactly two decimal places". Also it seems that you might need to round to two decimal places in a weird way. 0.015 ->
0.01. It seems like a really frustrating problem.

Now both `from __future__ import solution` and `iiiii` solved problem E! All our teams have solved at least one problem!
