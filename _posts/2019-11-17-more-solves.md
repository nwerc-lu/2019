`from future` solved H! A is an annoying simulation problem, if we have understood it correctly, so we hope A will come in soon as well! The solve on H places `from future` in 10th place!

`Balloon Overflow` also solved G placing them at 5 problems, with a really good time, placing them in 28th, with `iiiii` just behind in 30th place.

In 15 minutes the scoreboard will freeze, and we will only know what has been submitted, and not if it is correct until the award ceremony.
