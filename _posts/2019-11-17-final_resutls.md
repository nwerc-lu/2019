The final results are in!

- `from __future__ import solution` placed 14th
- `Balloon Overflow` placed 33th
- `¡i¡i¡` placed 34th

Even though `from __future__ import solution` would have wished for a medal, this is still the best result Lund University has had in many years, and we are very happy!

Now the flight leaves from Eindhoven towards Copenhagen. Thanks for reading this live blog!
