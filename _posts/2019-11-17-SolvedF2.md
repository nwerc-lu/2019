Now iiiii solved problem F, which means that all our teams have solved at least 2 problems! Great job!

[Problem C](https://open.kattis.com/contests/nwerc19open/problems/canvasline) are getting a lot of solves. We think it can be solved by a Greedy algorithm, but it's not obvious from the problem statement that tries to trick you.
