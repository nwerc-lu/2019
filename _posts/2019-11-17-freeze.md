Now the scoreboard is frozen. Since then `from future` has submitted on problem A.

The top 12 teams receive a medal, 4 golds, 4 silvers and 4 bronzes.

If `from future` have solved problem A, a medal seems quite probable!

The top 5 teams (from different universities) advance to the world finals. To achieve this `from future` probably need to solve an 8th problem, so far problem J, K and D have been solved by other teams.

Only an Oxford team (`Comme des Garçons`) has solved problem D, they are not solving the 4 easiest problems, since they don't want to advance to ICPC. There is a rule that you can only participate twice at the world finals.
