Now we are all set for NWERC! 

We are registered and got our t-shirts and goodie bags. We squeezed in some sightseeing and some really good food at Happyness Cafe, which we forgot to photograph, since it looked amazing! Waiting for the registration to open we also managed to do a 2.5h practice competition this afternoon.

Tomorrow it's time for the practice competition, which starts at 10:00.

Fun fact: Team `¡i¡i¡` received team number 1!
