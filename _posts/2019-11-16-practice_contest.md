The practice contest has started! The scoreboard can be found at [https://scoreboard.nwerc.eu/](https://scoreboard.nwerc.eu/), which is the same link for tomorrow as well!

The goal of the practice contest for our teams is to:
- Check how you print a file on paper
- Submit a clarification about the contest (to see how the system works)
- Test how fast the server is for different languages. They do this by seeing how long time it takes to do a matrix multiplication of matrixes of size 500.
- See how deep recursion is possible in python.

Below you can find the problems of the contest. Problem B seems a lot harder than A and C!
