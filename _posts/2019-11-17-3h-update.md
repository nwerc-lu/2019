Since our last post:
- `Balloon Overflow` solved C!
- `iiiii` solved G after 7 attempts! Awesome they got it in, and didn't give up!
- `from __future__ import solution` are trying to solve problem H, but got Wrong Answer.

We think problem A and H are the next up after the 5 easiest problems `C, E, F, G, I`.

Below you can see the standings of the top Swedish/Danish teams.
