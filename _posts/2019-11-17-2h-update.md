Since the last update:
- `from future` has solved G and C, now with 5 solved problems.
- `iiiii` has solved problem C and I, at 4 problems.
- `Balloon Overflow` has solved E, at 3 problems.

Generally they are solving the problems in difficulty order, except `from future` who solved problem C after problem G.

`Balloon Overflow` is submitting on C, hopefully they soon find their bug!

We have been in a coach meeting discussing a possible European finals for next year!
