Yesterday the subregional contest NCPC took place, which is used as the qualifier for NWERC at Lund University.

NCPC is divided up into student teams and professional teams, it is only the student teams that can advance to NWERC.

This years NCPC went extremely well for the teams from Lund. Out of 138 student teams `from __future__ import solution` solved 10 out of 11 problems and won the entire student contest, like last year! Second in the student contest were also a team from Lund, `¡i¡i¡` with 9 solved problems. Third among student teams in Lund became `Balloon Overflow`, solving 8 problems, 7th in the student contest and 4th in Sweden. This is as far as I know the best result Lund has had ever in NCPC!

Both `from __future__ import solution` and `¡i¡i¡` were at NWERC last year, and did really well, we hope for even better results this year! We also hope to be allowed to send 3 teams to NWERC this year, we think it's extremely likely since Lund did so well in NCPC. We will know for sure the 9th of October!

My team `Rainbow Unicode Characters`, also did pretty well. We also solved 8 problems and got a bit better time than `Ballon Overflow`, placing us 3rd in Lund, 10th among all participating teams. However we are all too old to be part of a student team and we even have an algorithm professor on our team, that has also self claimed the title team mascot.
